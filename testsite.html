<!-- First time making an html document :D  -->

<!-- Standard procedure starts with setting up the doctype -->
 <!doctype html>
 <!-- This is the html element. Wraps all concennt on page. Also known as the root element. Also contains lang attribute that sets primary language of doc -->
  <html lang="en-us">
    <!-- Next is the head element. It acts as a container for all content not shown to the viewer. AKA keywords and page desc for search results -->
     <head>
        <!-- Now here, we use meta to tell our doc which character set to use. In this instance, utf 8 includes most common characters  -->
         <meta charset="utf-8" />
         <!-- the next is consideration for mobile users. helping with formatting -->
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
         <!-- title is self explanatory. this is what appears in the tab -->
         <title>KaydoniusCam</title> 
     </head>
     <!-- body contains all content that will be seen by user -->
     <body>
        <!-- img is for images on our site. src is source attribute that contains path to our image file. alt attribute specifies text for when image doesnt load  -->
         <img src="" alt="KaydoniusCam" />
     </body>
  </html>


  <!-- Now that I've defined all the basic functionalities, webcam.html will have the feed attached -->
